# Snake Machine Learning

An attempt to use reinforcement learning to train a simple version of the classic snake game. Current configuration uses [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to build the snake game. Reinforcement learning process is largely non-functional. Snake seems unwilling to eat the apples. 

## Getting Started

Feel free to pull this project and add to/play with it if you feel inclined.

### Prerequisites

Packages you'll need (I recommend setting up a virtual environment for your project):

```
pygame
threading
random
```

### Installing

You can set up a virtual environment in the terminal with the command:

```
virtualenv [environment_name]
source [environment_name]/bin/activate
```

All of the packages that are not available natively in python are downloadable using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
After setting up your virtual environment, install all the project requirements into the virtual environment using pip:

```
pip install [package_name]
```

## Running

To run the snake game, navigate to the project directory and type:

```
python snake.py
```
